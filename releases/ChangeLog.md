## 1.0.1
- Touch sensitivity improvements: now less sensitive (by default) and a new setting can
  change that back to fast and sensitive, or select low sensitivity for noisy environments or
  personal preference.
- Remove respin feature (press 2) when showing seed words, and add confirm step
  to Cancel press. This misfeature was causing grief due to accidents during the

- Bugfix: possible lockup after entering an incorrect PIN code
- Bugfix: 'warm reset' inside Debug Functions didn't work properly.
